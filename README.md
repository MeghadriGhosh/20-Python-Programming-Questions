# 20-Python-programming-questions
Here are 20 Python programming questions that cover a variety of topics including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more. These will help you sharpen your problem-solving skills in preparation for technical interviews:

# Beginner to Intermediate Questions:
1. Reverse a String-
Write a function to reverse a string without using built-in methods.

2. Check if a String is Palindrome-
Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.

3. Find the Factorial of a Number-
Implement a recursive and an iterative solution to compute the factorial of a number.

4. Fibonacci Sequence-
Write a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

5. Check Prime Number-
Write a function to check whether a number is prime or not.

6. Find the Largest and Smallest Element in a List-
Write a function that finds the largest and smallest element in a list without using built-in functions like min() and max().

7. Count Vowels and Consonants in a String-
Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

8. Remove Duplicates from a List-
Write a function to remove duplicates from a list while maintaining order.

9. Sum of Digits of an Integer-
Write a function that takes an integer and returns the sum of its digits.

10. Merge Two Sorted Lists-
Write a function to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list.

# Intermediate to Advanced Questions:
11. Two Sum Problem-
Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a specific target number.

12. Longest Common Prefix-
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

13. Find All Permutations of a String-
Write a function to generate all permutations of a given string.

14. Count Occurrences of Each Element in a List-
Write a function that counts the occurrence of each element in a list.

15. Check if Two Strings are Anagrams-
Write a function to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.

16. Binary Search Implementation-
Implement a binary search algorithm to find the position of a target value in a sorted list.

17. Find the Missing Number in an Array-
Given an array containing n-1 numbers taken from 1 to n, find the missing number.

18. Flatten a Nested List-
Write a function to flatten a list that may contain nested lists.

19. Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)-
Write a function to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane’s algorithm.

20. LRU Cache Implementation-
Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache using Python’s collections.OrderedDict or a custom implementation.

These questions focus on core concepts in Python and are commonly asked in interviews. They cover recursion, iteration, algorithm optimization, string manipulation, and data structures, providing a well-rounded set of problems to practice.
